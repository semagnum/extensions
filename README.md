## My Official Extensions Repository

Welcome!
Here you can add my repository in Blender 4.2 to access all my free extensions.

Just add the following URL in Blender as a remote repository:

> [https://extensions.spencermagnusson.com/add_ons/index.json](https://extensions.spencermagnusson.com/add_ons/index.json)

If you need them offline, you can download them individually,
either from their own repositories or the zip files included in this repository.
