## My Official Extensions Repository

Welcome!
Here you can add my repository in Blender 4.2 to access all my free extensions.

Just add the following URL in Blender as a remote repository:

> [https://semagnum.github.io/extensions/add_ons/index.json](https://semagnum.github.io/extensions/add_ons/index.json)

If you need them offline, you can download them individually,
either from their own repositories or the zip files included in this repository.

- [Copy Render Command](https://projects.blender.org/SMagnusson/copy_render_command)
  generates a command to render your current file,
  and copies it to your clipboard.
  Paste it into your favorite terminal, and enjoy command line rendering!
